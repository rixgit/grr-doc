= Getting Started =

This document describes getting a server and clients up and running for the first time.

== Requirements ==

 * A linux box. At the moment the full install is thoroughly tested end to end
   on Ubuntu Server 12.04, 12.10, 13.10, 14.04 64-bit. It probably works on
   other things fine, but that is what it's tested on. Note we no longer provide a 32-bit server version since standing up new 32-bit linux servers is not something rational people do, and there are many places you can get 64-bit virtual servers for ~free.  We use the "amd64" notation, but this just means 64-bit, it runs fine on Intel.
 * Recommend > 1GB Ram and a modern CPU if you want to run everything on one box
   (note that free Amazon EC2 instances don't have enough RAM).
 * Some clients to talk to the server. OSX, Windows and Linux agents are
   supported.

== Making it Go ==

Download the installation script e.g. using wget:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/grr/master/scripts/install_script_ubuntu.sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the installation script:

-------------------------------------------------------
bash install_script_ubuntu.sh
-------------------------------------------------------

*Note that the installation script requires bash to run and does not work with
plain sh.*

 - Run through all the prompts you get given. By default it asks you before
   every command it runs. Hitting A (Always) for an answer will run through the
   whole script. If it encounters an error it should tell you where it failed.
 - This will:
  * Download and install all the dependencies via apt-get
  * Install prebuilt dependencies that require customization or fixes due to
    versions or patches required (pytsk, m2crypto, django)
  * Download the latest deb for your distribution and install it
  * Run grr_config_updater initialize to ask you some questions then generate
    the keys, users, binaries, drivers and config for your install
 - Once this completes successfully you should have a working server with an
   admin interface on port 8000. And you should also have grr_console in your
   path to interact via console.
 - The pre-packaged clients should be visible under Manage Binaries ->
   executables -> Windows -> installers. Download the client you need.
 - Run the client on the target machine as administrator.
  * For Windows you will see a 32 and 64 bit installer. Run the installer as
    admin (it should load the UAC prompt if you are not admin). It should run
    silently and install the client to  c:\windows\system32\grr\%version%\. It
    will also install a Windows Service, start it, and configure the registry
    keys to make it talk to the URL/server you specified during repack of the
    clients on the server.
  * For OSX you will see a pkg file, install the pkg. It will add something to
    launchd to automatically run it and start it.
  * For Linux you will see a deb file, install it. For testing purposes you can
    run the client on the same machine as the server if you like.

== Testing Release ==

Follow the same instructions as above, but add the -t flag to force the script to pull the testing release instead.
